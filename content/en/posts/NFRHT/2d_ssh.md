### Abstract
Topological optical states are promising in waveguiding, sensing, and information processing which are localized over the boundaries and robustly protected by the band topology. Topological phonon polaritons (TPhPs), as a special type of topological optical states, have been shown to play a vital role in modulating radiative heat transfer in many-particle systems. In this paper, we propose subwavelength lattices composed of identical SiC nanoparticles (NPs) which support phonon polaritons to mimic the 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. By using the coupled-dipole model and taking all the near- and far-field dipole-dipole interactions into account, we numerically calculate the band structures of the NP arrays under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and study the topological properties of the NP arrays characterized by their 2D Zak phases. Subsequently, we confirm the existence of edge states and high-order corner states in the topologically nontrivial 2D SSH lattices under open boundary conditions (OBCs), which are protected by the nonzero 2D Zak phases and consistent with the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The radiative heat transfer between certain NPs is calculated based on many-body radiative heat transfer theory. We demonstrate that these high-order TPhPs can considerably modulate long-range radiative heat transport by constructing the topological “heat guiding” systems made of NP arrays with different boundary conditions. Moreover, by decomposing the radiative heat flux into two parts according to the polarization directions of dipoles, we find that the high-order TPhPs play different roles in the in-plane and out-of-plane components. We further show the modulation effect can robustly exist in the topologically nontrivial lattice by introducing defects and disorders. Our study provides an in-depth understanding on the near-field radiative heat transfer in many-particle systems with high-order topological properties.
